Magbor.tws is a TextPad Workspace file. I used TextPad to develop this
    whole game, and I used that file to open all of the PHP and JS files
    at once. Feel free to ignore or delete it, it will not break anything.
============================================================================

=REQUIREMENTS===============================================================
Server-side:
    Apache is recommended, but any web server should work fine.
    PHP 4 or 5  (I used 5.1.2)
    MySQL       (I used 5.0.20)
Client-side:
    Web browser with JavaScript and CSS enabled.
    Tested on IE 6 and Firefox 1.5 - Firefox is recommended
============================================================================

=EXTRA NOTE=================================================================
Because this was a personal experiment, and I wasn't initially planning on
submitting it to SourceForge, the code is a mess. I'm sure you will have
plenty of suggestions on how to write it better, etc. Please hold those
suggestions until after the next version, when I will have it cleaned up
and much more efficient. I just wanted to go ahead and get my working
example out on the internet for everyone to see.

Thanks to the following people:
    -Everyone at Freenode #JavaScript for helping me sort through my various
        JavaScript problems

    -My friends, for helping me test the game - especially zhawx, for
        finding weird bugs (and getting the idea of coloring a character
        green like the grass)
