Known bugs, issues, and limitations
-----------------------------------

-changelook.php will sometimes refuse to display
 the character's current look in the preview image,
 or will have the wrong colors in the selection boxes.
 This only happens on load and functionality is
 not affected, and it only happens sometimes. It
 will be fixed in the next release.
-The 'admin' column of users and the 'equippable'
 column of itemtypes are not used and mean nothing.
-Some images in the /Images folder are not used,
 but might be used in the future. Consider it a
 preview into what's coming up next!
-DDOS and chat flood attacks are not prevented!
-Walking speed is not enforced, however users ARE
 limited to one tile at a time (unless they manage
 to move diagonally, in which case it's the [square
 root of 2] tiles at a time)
-Magbor does not work in all browsers, especially
 browsers on Apple computers. Browser support has
 not been extensively tested, but Magbor seems to
 work fine on IE and Firefox.
-PHP's enforcement of map boundaries is currently
 hardcoded to the width and height of Default.map.
 The next release will load dimensions from the
 map file, but for now if you change Default.map,
 you will have to change those hardcoded values.
-JavaScript can have some interesting bugs if
 internet connection is lost at certain points in
 time, depending on the browser. This is known and
 will be tested sometime in the future. It is
 recommended to have an always-on internet
 connection, such as DSL or Cable.
