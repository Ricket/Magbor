=======================================================================
session_mysql.php does NOT have to be used, you can use the regular
session handler if you'd like to. just comment out the require_onces
of session_mysql.php and add a different include that creates a mysql
connection and uses the magbor database. i just decided that i like the
idea of having my session "files" in my database, even though it makes
a bit more database traffic.

!! WARNINGS - READ ALL OF THIS! !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game creates heavy traffic! It is recommended to
run the game only as localhost or within LAN for now.
I am not responsible for any fees associated with
the extra traffic caused by this game. In fact, I am
not responsible for ANYTHING you do concerning this
game. You are on your own, and you are free to
experiment as you like, but leave me out of it!

The average user will receive about 200 bytes of data
each second, IF nobody else has performed any actions
(an action is walking, chatting, logging in/out, etc.)
This is increased by the user or other nearby users
moving around, talking, or logging in and out.
I have not measured exactly how much bandwidth is used,
but I can assure you it is pretty heavy, and should be
used sparingly. I will make sure to greatly reduce the
load in the next release, but this release was simply
a proof of concept.

Also, there are no DDOS attack prevention methods in
here, so someone could easily spam chat with large
messages and instantly raise bandwidth, possibly even
crashing older computers. This has not been tested,
but I will put protection methods in the next release.
